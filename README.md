# UseMemo

- Before we start , lets understand what memoization means
Itâ€™s a mildly DSA concept, It means remembering some output given an input and not computing it again. {sort of caching thing}.

Let's understand `UseMemo` by doing some assignments:

- If I ask you to create an app that does two things :-

        1. Increases a counter by 1.
        2. Lets user put a value in an input box (n) and you need to show sum from 1-n.

        Note:- Everything needs to be inside App.
